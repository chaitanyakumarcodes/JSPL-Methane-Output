### JSPL Methane Output Prediction

This project focuses on predicting methane output from JSPL's coal gasification plant using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to forecast methane production based on various operational parameters of the plant, optimizing the process for higher efficiency. 

#### Key Features:
- **Data Processing**: Includes extensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle missing values, anomalies, and scaling of features.
- **Modeling**: Explores multiple machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to determine the best model for methane output prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Provides performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualization tools for analyzing feature importance and model performance trends.

The goal of this project is to aid in decision-making at JSPLâ€™s coal gasification plant by providing accurate methane output forecasts that can inform operational adjustments for improved output and sustainability.
