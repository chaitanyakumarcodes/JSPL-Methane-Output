## 1. Project Overview

This repository implements a data-driven modelling pipeline that predicts the methane output of JSPL‚Äôs coal gasification plant. By leveraging operational parameters, the goal is to provide forecasts that can inform adjustments to production processes, improve efficiency, and support sustainability initiatives.

---

## 2. Motivation

* Coal-gasification plants generate methane as part of their operational process; accurate forecasting enables better planning and optimization of plant operations.
* For JSPL, having a predictive tool means potential cost savings, improved resource utilization, and reduced emissions risks.
* This project reflects the growing industry need to integrate data-science workflows into heavy engineering operations.

---

## 3. Dataset & Features

* The data was collected from JSPL‚Äôs gasification units, containing several months of continuous plant-operation logs.
* It captures relationships between process variables (like temperature, pressure, gas composition) and the resulting methane concentration/output.
* Key preprocessing steps include:

  * Removal of missing or inconsistent readings
  * Outlier detection and replacement
  * Normalization using the trained scaler (`scaler.pkl`)
* The cleaned dataset is stored as `Tab_Data ‚Äì Copy-Updated.xlsx`.

## 4. Data Overview

The dataset consists of **time-series process parameters** from the coal-gasification plant, sampled at regular operational intervals. It integrates raw sensor readings, derived variables, and target methane-output percentages.

| Column Category                | Example Features                               | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feed Properties**            | Coal Flow Rate, Moisture Content               | Characteristics of the input feedstock                      |
| **Operating Conditions**       | Temperature, Pressure, Steam Flow, Oxygen Flow | Core process control parameters from reactors and gasifiers |
| **Gas Composition**            | CO, CO‚ÇÇ, H‚ÇÇ, CH‚ÇÑ percentages                   | Output gas mixture components                               |
| **Catalyst & Reactor Metrics** | Catalyst Age, Bed Level, Conversion Efficiency | Indicators of reaction performance                          |
| **Output Variable**            | Methane Output (%)                             | Target variable used for regression modelling               |

* Total samples: ~5,000‚Äì10,000 rows (depending on filtered range)
* Number of features: ~15‚Äì25 numerical process parameters
* Target variable: Methane output percentage (`CH4_output`)
* Sampling rate: Hourly/shift-based operational data

The dataset provides a solid foundation for supervised regression modelling, capturing key process variations and correlations that drive methane yield.

## 5. Methodology

* Notebook `methane_optimization_updated.ipynb` explores multiple modelling approaches.

  * Baseline: Linear Regression
  * Advanced: Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, etc.
* The best performing model has been serialized (`svr_model.pkl`) for production use.
* A simple web-application interface (`app.py`) allows users to input operational variables and obtain methane output predictions in real-time.
* The modelling workflow includes:

  1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
  2. Feature transformation & selection
  3. Model training & hyperparameter tuning
  4. Performance evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
  5. Deployment readiness via Flask (or similar lightweight framework) in `app.py`.
